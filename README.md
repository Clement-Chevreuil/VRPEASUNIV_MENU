## MENU VR-PEAS

VR-PEAS (Virtual Reality PEdAgogical Scenarisation tool) is an authoring tool with a service for the automatic operationalisation of VR-oriented pedagogical scenarios.
It has been experimented with different audiences: teachers who are experts in pedagogical scenarisation, teachers with no previous experience in pedagogical scenarisation and teachers who have already participated in the realization of a VRLE. VR-PEAS has been created and released by LIUM (Laboratoire d’Informatique de l’Université du Mans). 
This part of the project consists of creating a 2D menu using Unity which gives the opportunity to the user to add a new environment, object or simply add a new animation to an existing object. This menu should be the intermediary between the user and the VRPEAS project.
